# 04_Pandas_Challlenge
## Overview

This repository contains a main file and a correlating file with CSV files for analyzing and summarizing CSV data into the Jupyter Notebook file. The directions for the module were to create a jupyter file, including a resources folder (for storing the original CSV file), and using the CSV files to merge and complete a final analysis of various aspects of the data for this challenge.

## Results

In the 04_Pandas_Challenge, this dataset is an analysis of 15 different schools. This dataset comprises both district and charter schools, almost 40,000 students, ranging from 9th-12th grade, and with individual budgets. The analysis further breaks down average math and reading scores from each school as well as aggregates across each school type, size, budget, and spending. Additional analysis identifies the top performing and low performing schools, as well as individual grade level performance. A summary and commmentary about data correlations is appended to the top of the main file as well. 

## Usage

You can use this file to analyze the data in the corresponding resource CSV.

1. Open the respective file (`PyCitySchools.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.

3. Run individual cells within the (`PyCitySchools.ipynb) to see the calculations of breakdown by category.

4. The results will be displayed in the terminal.
